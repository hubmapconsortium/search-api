JSON Schemas for documents from the [HuBMAP Search API](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/search-api/):
The [HuBMAP Portal](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/portal-ui) depends on there being a consistent document structure.

The wrapped `metadata` elements in these documents come from metadata TSVs submitted along with the data;
Their structure is described by [ingest-validation-tools](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/ingest-validation-tools/tree/master/docs).
